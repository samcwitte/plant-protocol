# Plant Protocol
Client-server project for ECE:3540 Communication Networks in the form of a relaxing plant game!
User data is saved to a server-side database and retrieved on client login.

## How to Setup
1. Download the repository files
2. First, run the server (`py server.py`)
3. Next, run the client (`py client.py`)
5. In the client terminal, enter the servers IP address (IPv4)
6. In the client terminal, type an existing or new username (3-16 characters)

## How to Play
1. Filter though your plants by pressing the displayed arrows
2. Your plant hunger increases with time, press 'f' to feed
3. Your plant thirst increases with time, press 'w' to water
4. You make money every second, buy new plants by pressing the 'p' button
5. Click your plant to level it up!
6. No need to save anything -- it's all handled by the server. Just exit the game window.
